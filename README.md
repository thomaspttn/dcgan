# dcgan

## Introduction
This is an attempt at a DCGAN by Thomas Patton based off the DCGAN tutorial available on the PyTorch website. The primary advancements for this DCGAN are an updated ``scrape.py`` which can be used for Wikiart, but which can also be modified to be used on a specific artist.

## Getting Started
Make sure to use ```src/scrape.py``` to pull images from Wikiart. This is currently far from optimized, but it works well for pulling the images without the use of libraries like Selenium. This may or may not be optimized in the future.
